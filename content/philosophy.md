### As midwives we believe that…

1. Childbearing is a profound experience, which carries significant meaning to the woman, her family, and the community.
2. Birth is a normal physiological process.
3. Midwives are the most appropriate care providers to attend low risk women during pregnancy, labor, birth and the postnatal period. 4. Midwifery care empowers women to assume responsibility for their health and for the health of their families.
5. Midwifery care takes place in partnership with women and is personalized, continuous, and non-authoritarian.
6. Midwifery care combines art and science. Midwifery care is holistic in nature, grounded in an understanding of the social, emotional, cultural, spiritual, psychological, and physical experiences of women and based upon the best available evidence.
7. Midwives have confidence in, trust in, and have respect for women and their capabilities in childbirth.
8. The woman is the primary decision-maker in her care, and she has the right to information that enhances her decision-making abilities.

### As a result:

1. In keeping with the sanctity of life, Midwifery care promotes, protects, and supports women’s reproductive rights.
2. Midwifery practice promotes and advocates for non-intervention in normal childbirth.
3. Midwifery practice builds women’s self confidence in handling childbirth.
4. Midwives use technology appropriately and refer in a timely manner when problems arise.
5. Midwives offer anticipatory and flexible care. 6. Midwives provide women with appropriate information and advice in a way that promotes participation and facilitates informed decision making.
7. Midwifery care maintains trust and mutual respect between the midwife and the family.

### In order to provide the highest quality of service the Midwives expect:

1. The woman to keep all scheduled appointments on time.
2. Come to visits prepared to discuss any questions or concerns.
3. Read all materials that are provided in the office for educational purposes.
4. Seek out educational experiences including, classes, books, seminars.
5. Always call the Midwife on call before going to the hospital, emergency room, or labor and delivery.
6. Take responsibility for your own health, pregnancy and birth experience.
